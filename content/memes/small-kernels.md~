Another ([[vgg-rule]]) rule which may be attributed to [[paper:VGGnet]]. The use of consistently small kernels, often 3x3 (or 3 for conv1d): "The image is passed through a stack of convolutional (conv.) layers, where we use filters with a very small [[theme:receptive field]]: 3x3 (which is the smallest size to capture the notion of left/right, up/down, center)." (VGGnet paper, p. 2).

As for the motivation: "we use very small 3x3 receptive fields throughout the whole net, which are convolved with the input at every pixel (with stride 1). It is easy to see that a stack of two 3x3 conv. layers (without spatial pooling in between) has an effective receptive field of 5x5; three such layers have a 7 × 7 effective receptive field. So what have we gained by using, for instance, a stack of three 3 × 3 conv. layers instead of a single 7 × 7 layer? First, we incorporate three non-linear rectification layers instead of a single one, which makes the decision function more discriminative. Second, we decrease the number of parameters: assuming that both the input and the output of a three-layer 3 × 3 convolution stack has C channels, the stack is parametrised by 3 (32C2) = 27C2 weights; at the same time, a single 7 × 7 conv. layer would require 72C2 = 49C2 parameters, i.e. 81% more. This can be s een as imposing a regularisation on the 7 × 7 conv. filters, forcing them to have a decomposition through the 3 × 3 filters (with non-linearity injected in between)." (VGGnet paper, pp. 2-3).
